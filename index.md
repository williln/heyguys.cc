        <h1>problem</h1>
        <p class="lead">"Hey guys" is a common salutation, but it's not gender neutral. People who aren't men can feel excluded when addressed as "guys," even if that is not the intent.</p>
        <h1>solution</h1>
        <p class="lead">Instead of using "hey guys," consider one of these several alternatives:</p>
        <ul class="lead">
          <li>everyone</li>
          <li>folks</li>
          <li>all</li>
          <li>friends</li>
          <li>team</li>
          <li>y'all</li>
          <li>yinz</li>
          <li>youse</li>
          <li>people</li>
          <li>peeps</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="lead">The aim of <a href="https://heyguys.cc/">heyguys.cc</a> is to encourage the use of inclusive language in online and in-person communication.</p>
